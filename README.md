# Data Analysis and Modeling with PySpark and Factor Analysis

This project demonstrates data analysis and modeling using PySpark, factor analysis, and various statistical and machine learning libraries. It provides an example of how to load, preprocess, and analyze a dataset, as well as how to perform factor analysis and other statistical tests.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib factor-analyzer pingouin seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn

Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset(s) used in the project.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with detailed code examples and explanations.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, factor analysis, and statistical tests.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Usage
Data Loading: The project utilizes PySpark for loading and handling large datasets efficiently. Use the SparkSession object to read data.

Data Preprocessing: Explore data preprocessing techniques, such as cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables using libraries like Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

Factor Analysis: Discover how to perform factor analysis using the factor_analyzer library. Calculate Bartlett's sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure to assess data suitability.

Statistical Tests: Utilize pingouin, statsmodels, and scipy for various statistical tests, including Pearson correlations, model comparisons, and more.

Visualization: Visualize data and analysis results using Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating informative statistical plots.
